## Overview & Scope of School Metrics Analysis
### Initial Analysis: Comprehensive Analysis
Provided a comprehensive school district analysis across against metrics for reading, math and overall success. Within this project we delivered statistical analysis to the school board on myriad high school performance metrics, against their overall size, spending and type of school. 

After analysis was complete, the school board became aware of polluted data: specifically the reading and math stats for 9th graders at a participating high school needed to be nulled - there was dishonesty in the reporting. compromised data, lack of integrity - data has no integriety. 

### Secondary Comparative Analysis: Excluding Polluted Data
The second signifact deliverable to the school board was a comparative analysis of the metrics performed using/including the statistics from the 9th graders at Thomas High School and the analysis excluding the polluted data: how much was the ultimate analysis impacts by this. Below are the comparisons of the analysis before and after removal of 9th grade etc to illuminate the impact.

## Results: Relative Impact Before & After Polluted/Compromised Data Removal
### District Summary Results
How is the district summary affected?
### School Summary Results
How is the school summary affected?
### Relative Performance Change Thomas High School
How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?
## How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:
### Math & Reading Scores by Grade
Math and reading scores by grade
### Scores by School Spending
Scores by school spending
### Scores by School Size
Scores by school size
### Scores by School Type
Scores by school type


## Summary: 
Summarize four changes in the updated school district analysis after reading and math scores for the ninth grade at Thomas High School have been replaced with NaNs.
